###How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I spent an hour and a half on this code.
I would have added a back-end to this code such as a database for people that may want to save their favourite restaurant or other sort of data.


###What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

There were no special features that was add to this application. Everything was done in React.js, if given more time I would have a used Sequelize to connect to MySQL for a back-end

###How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

I would add an automated testing or connected to an issue management software where it will show all the issue my application/web have. 

I have done this before for another project that I am currently working on with a group.

###How would you improve the API that you just used?

Ways I would improve the API are by adding more information about the restaurant(ex. type of food). Another way is to change the representation of the price, because it is not intuitive of what the number represent
